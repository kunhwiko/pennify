.# Abstract

This document specifies a new protocol for a music streaming service in which a server with music files responds to client requests for music.

{mainmatter}

# Introduction

The design and the implementation of this protocol informs users the concerns behind constructing different protocols for streaming services. Common constraints that are involved are header and message formats, proper framing of messages, and the behavior between the client and server in response to a message. 

While the protocol by no means describes the complication of such protocols like RTSP or DASH chunking, it still educates users with the basic ideas of message types, message formatting, and server and client state transitions involved in streaming.  

## Terminology

The keywords **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**,
**SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL**, when they appear in this document, are
 to be interpreted as described in [@RFC2119].

# Messages

## Message Types

At a minimum, the protocol **SHOULD** handle the following messages. These messages are similar to those of RTSP. 

Client messages:\

  - setup : request to connect with the server\

  - list : request the list of songs existing in the server\

  - play : request to play a certain song\

  - stop : request the server to pause sending data packets\

  - teardown : request to disconnect with the server\


Server messages:\

  - list : return the list of songs existing in the server\

  - play : provide the client with chunks of data for the specified song\

  - stop : stop providing client with chunks of data for the specified song\ 

  - error : tell the client that an error has occurred (e.g. song does not exist)\


## Message Formatting - Text vs. Binary

The client and server will use packets that store information about message types (e.g. list, play), song number, timestamps, and data in text format.

When sending over packets, only necessary components (e.g. client does not need to send over the 'data' attribute) are 
stringified, sent, and decoded back to a packet at the other end.  


## Message Formatting - Message Delimiters

Attributes of a single packet can be stringified to a string delimited by <NEXT;>. Note that the string **MAY** be delimited in other ways. 

Client --> Server Example:\

  
  - play<NEXT;>song number<NEXT;>timestamp<NEXT;><END;>\


Server --> Client Example:\

  
  - play<NEXT;>song number<NEXT;>timestamp<NEXT;>data<NEXT;><END;>\


Each packet starts with a message type, and an <END;> phrase is used to mark the end of a message.\


# State

##  State the server should store per-client

  The server **MUST** keep track of the following:\

  - connected : the server **MUST** make sure that the client has an established connection\ 

  - song number : the server **MUST** keep track of what the client is currently listening to\ 

  - timestamp : the server **MUST** keep track of what chunk the client is listening to\

  - play/stop : the server **MUST** keep track of whether the client wants to play or stop a song\


## How messages enable state transitions

Different message types render the state of the client and server in different ways.\ 

Client receives from Server:\
  
  - list : takes priority over playing, lists the songs, and then resumes current state\ 

  - play : play music state\

  - stop : takes priority over playing, stops the current song, and move to pause state\

  - error : notifies the client and then resumes current state\

Server receives from Client:\

  - setup : server starts maintaining an open connection with the client\

  - list : maintains the current state\ 

  - play : server starts transmitting data of a specified song\

  - stop : server stops transmitting data\

  - teardown : server takes priority over any other state and changes to a closed state\ 

# Performance Considerations

  - The "list" command **MIGHT** very briefly pause a song because it takes priority over a "play" state\

  - Since strings are **REQUIRED** to be delimited by <NEXT;>, our assumption is that there are no "song number" or "data" values that are <NEXT;>\
